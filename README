Custom Hash table implementation in Python 🐍 just  for fun, but also to understand a little deeper the different types of implementations that can be done for
resizing and collision handling 🤖 Who knows, perhaps I will end up implementing a basic cache system which can be deployed in a cloud provider! lets see 🤷

In the future I would also like to implement it in Golang as an excuse to start learning the language 🚀

All the coding sessions will be recorded live 🎥 and uploaded to [nicodes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKGZLR6ETz-Z3e1hzkuy2Ig)
